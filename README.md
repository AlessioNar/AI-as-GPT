# MyThesis

Repository containing code written for patent analysis in my master thesis

The code is mainly written in R but there are some shell script that I used to reconstitute the partial PATSTAT dataset regarding WIPO patents from 1995 to 2019. 

Data is not included in the repository.

## Structure of the repository

The scripts used for performing the analysis are contained in the "r" folder, which contains four folders:

- data_gathering
- control_sample
- technology_evolution
- generality
- network_analysis
- utilities
